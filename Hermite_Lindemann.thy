lemma Hermite_Lindemann_aux2:
  fixes \<alpha> :: "complex set" and \<beta> :: "complex \<Rightarrow> int"
  assumes [intro]: "finite X"
  assumes nz:   "\<And>x. x \<in> X \<Longrightarrow> \<beta> x \<noteq> 0"
  assumes alg:  "\<And>x. x \<in> X \<Longrightarrow> algebraic x"
  assumes sum0: "(\<Sum>\<alpha>\<in>X. of_int (\<beta> x) * exp \<alpha>) = 0"
  shows   "X = {}"
proof (rule ccontr)
